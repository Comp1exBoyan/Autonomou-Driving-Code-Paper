# Tracking tracking for low-cost autonomous driving 
Part of the source code of the autonomous driving system, mainly consists of control module and planning module.

Constarined MPC and nonlinear algorithm for traking control and ADRC for motor control. Hybrid A* for global planning and TEB planner for local planning.

can_module_movebase -- the control module of the autonomous vehicle with movebase
